# Global functions

There are some common functions which can be used anywhere in JavaScript code. I had put all these function in their separate category so that it's easier to understand.

### Encoding decoding URI and URI Components
> Order of items in the list is different from how the appear in the documentation below.
* [decodeURI()](decodeURI.md)
* [decodeURIComponent()](decodeURIComponent.md)
* [encodeURI()](encodeURI.md)

* [encodeURIComponent()](encodeURIComponent.md)

### Helpful in validation
* [isFinite()](isFinite.md)
* [isNaN()](isNaN.md)

### Parsing values
* [parseFloat()](parseFloat.md)
* [parseInt()](parseInt.md)

### Evaluate JavaScript code stored as string.
* [eval()](eval.md)

### Memory management - Difficult to understand and use
* [FinalizationRegistry()](FinalizationRegistry.md)

### Escape and unescape characters [Deprecated]
* [escape()](escape.md) [Deprecated]
* [unescaped()](unescaped.md) [Deprecated]

> Note: EvalError() is also a global function but it put it into a different category because it was more related to Errors. It's a personal decision.
