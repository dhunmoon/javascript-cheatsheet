# Global functions

There are some common functions which can be used anywhere in JavaScript code. I had put all these function in their separate category so that it's easier to understand.

### Encoding decoding URI and URI Components
> Order of items in the list is different from how the appear in the documentation below.
* decodeURI() 
* decodeURIComponent()
* encodeURI()

* encodeURIComponent()

### Helpful in validation
* isFinite()
* isNaN()

### Parsing values
* parseFloat()
* parseInt()

### Evaluate JavaScript code stored as string.
* eval()

### Memory management - Difficult to understand and use
* FinalizationRegistry()

### Escape and unescape characters [Deprecated]
* escape() [Deprecated]
* [unescaped()](unescaped.md) [Deprecated]

> Note: EvalError() is also a global function but it put it into a different category because it was more related to Errors. It's a personal decision.
